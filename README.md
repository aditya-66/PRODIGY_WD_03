## ðŸŽ¯ Project Completed: Tic Tac Toe Game

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully built a Tic Tac Toe Game as part of my web development journey! ðŸ•¹

### In this project, I created a fun and interactive game that:

- Allows two players to play turn-by-turn

- Detects winners and highlights the winning combination

- Declares a draw when no moves are left

- Has a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface

- Is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only

### ðŸ’¡ Through this project, I enhanced my JavaScript logic-building skills, learned about event handling, array manipulation, and DOM updates, while also focusing on building a smooth user experience.
